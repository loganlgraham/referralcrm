# Referral CRM Template

A sleek, modern starter template for a referral CRM focused on agent-to-agent relationship management.

## Features

- Dashboard metrics, funnel visualization, and recent activity feed
- Referral pipeline table with status and source filtering
- Agent network grid highlighting partner insights and quick actions
- Kanban-style pipeline view and follow-up task list
- Global search across referrals, agents, and pipeline columns
- Modal forms for capturing new referrals and tasks (console logging for now)

## Getting Started

This is a static HTML/CSS/JS prototype. To explore the UI locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser directly, or
2. Serve the directory with any static file server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

Customize the placeholder data in `app.js` to adapt the template for real-world integrations.
